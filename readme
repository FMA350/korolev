Korolev: Newtonian simulation and Space Guidance for you CL!



Korolev is program designed to simulate orbital mechanics for you!
Proudly made for Command Line only.



Installation:

Clone the git repository onto your system. Jump into it
and then type:

"make"
"make clean"
"./builds/Korolev"

Usage:

Type "help" in the program console for a list of the available commands.
All functionalities are activated by typing the command name without any
argument. When and if the program needs further interaction it
will request it to the user.

Functionalities:

-Navigation related
Korolev knows how to calculate the orbital speed of an object given its orbit

-Simulation related

Able to simulate a n-body problem and to solve for a given amount of time-steps using different methods:
->Euler method
->Runge-Kutta 4th method (in development).

Able to add and remove a bodies.
Able to load and store bodies for further simulations.
Able to store a log of the simulation (saves the object info at every time-step) for further analysis.
Able to calculate and show the initial energy of a system and the final one (useful to analyze the accuracy of the methods).
